Hey Nick you forgot to leave your email in the discord, so to update, I've been recruited into a startup on some software to build from scratch, 
but I thought I'd pitch our project off as a possible additional project. The person I'm working with right now mentioned that they have a 
contact in FinTech and might be interested in the project so I wanted to reach out and just let you know and see if you would be interested
in joining Alastair and myself in this. 

Hey Alastair don't approve this merge it's to get Nick's attention like I mentioned before thanks.
